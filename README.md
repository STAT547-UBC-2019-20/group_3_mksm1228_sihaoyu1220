# Predictive Model for the Price of Canadian Airbnb Listings

This is a group project by Team Project 3 members, @mksm1228 and @sihaoyu1220, for the 2019-2020 STAT547M session. 

## Dataset

We will be utilizing the Canadian Airbnb listings dataset which contains summary information and metrics for listings in Canada generated by Inside Airbnb. The data was sourced from publicly available information from the official Airbnb site. It has been analyzed, cleaned and aggregated by Inside Airbnb. 

## Research Question

Which factors are most likely to influence the price of Airbnb listings in Canadian cities?

2. Check the contents of each folder and read all READMEs.

3. Ensure the following packages are installed:
- ggplot2
- here
- tidyverse
- corrplot
- data.table
- knitr
- broom
- testthat
- docopt

4. Run the following scripts (in order) **with** the appropriate arguments specified.

```r
1. USE GNU MAKE  
if < > is used , this means that multiple options can be inputted. 

# clean all the folders
make clean

# Restore all the files
make all

2. USE GNU MAKE ON INDIVIDUAL ITEMS
# download the data
make Data/<Canadian city.csv> 
For example: make Data/montreal_raw.csv

# run exploratory data analysis
make Images/<image.png> 
For example: make Images/Number_of_listings.png

# linear regression analysis
make RDS/step_lm.rds

# linear regression plot
make Images/Model_Diagnostics.png

# knit report to html or pdf
make Docs/Final_Report.html 
make Docs/Final_Report.pdf

3. RUN EACH RSCRIPT INDIVIDUALLY
# load all data
Rscript Scripts/load_data.R --data_url=http://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/

# access cleaned data
Rscript Scripts/clean_data.R --path=Data --filename=cleaned_data

# explorating data analysis
Rscript Scripts/EDA.R --data_path=Data/cleaned_data.csv --image_path=Images

# perform linear regression
Rscript Scripts/linear_regression.R --datafile=cleaned_data.csv

# knitting to html or pdf
Rscript Scripts/knitting.R --rmd_file=Final_Report.rmd
```

## Dashboard Proposal

### Dashboard Description

This app has two features. One is to show the pricing density and the other is to show listings distribution on a map. The features can be switched by a button. From a dropdown list, users will be able to filter out their interested variables, such as whether they want a superhost or not, their destination, room type, number of accommodates, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and how strict they want the cancellation policy to be.  Users can compare different pricing density plots and listings disribution maps by selecting different dropdown options. 

### Usage Senarios

Jason is a travel enthusiast and Canada is his next destination. He plans to go to several cities in Canada, such as Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto. He wants to be able to explore how much does the Airbnb cost in those cities and  budgeted for his trip. When Jason logs on to the "Preditive Pricing Tool for Canadian Airbnb Listings", he can filter his interested variables. He filters room type to be apartment first, but the price is a little high for him. So he filters room type to be shared room, when he does so, he may notice that the price is much lower. He can also press the button to switch to map, and use map to visualize where those shared room Airbnb listings locate and make decision in advance. By filtering the variables, Jason hypothesizes that the average price in Vancouver is the highest among other cities. Also, the more accommodates, bedrooms, and bathrooms causes a higher Airbnb price.
